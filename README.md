## 2/24/2019 
Slow start today, we need to improve for the next week. Here are the things as homework for the week 1...

1. Everyone do the first 10 problems from the 2018 test
2. Review other persons's solutions and see if you can improve it.
3. Read about the sets, lists and dictionaries, List comprehension and Dictionaty comprehension (spend max 1 hour)
4. Familiarize with pytest, may be do a sample pytest for one of the 10 programs (max 1 hour)

Be here by 6 PM next week, March 3rd.

Make sure you have the dev environment set up on your laptop (including pytest in visual studio).

Good job Arnav and Rithvik for completing the first 10 problems. 
Some nice programming concepts were put in place, we still can make some improvements on the programming methodology, lets discuss more details next week. 

#### This week please comeplte problem number 11 to 15 of the 2018 test.

and read up python build in functions at https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in and practice all well in the browser. 

Will discuss the first 20 problmes next Sunday along with the pytest tricks and tips.

We did lot of test driven development. 

Make sure to follwo the 3 steps for solutioning the problem.

1. Read all details of the question and Write the test cases 
2. Design the algorithm (use pictures as much as possible)
3. Program design
4. Develop the program iteratively...

#### Homework: Make sure to write test cases for all the 15 problems, and practice the testable code... make sure you got all correct, dont have to do the problems 4 remaing problems, but read and understand the problem to discuss in the class.
Make sure to read up the python build in functions from the link from last week...

Things to learn:

- Learn string/floating point formatting and rounding, etc.
- Learn math functions in standard library.
- Use REPL more for debugging.
- Separate larger functions into smaller functions for easy testability.

#### Homework: Solve the first 10 problems of 2017 test. Make sure to write test cases for all the 10 problems...
There are only 4 weeks left, we need to get bt serious. Highest score so far for the winners in 'Novice' section is 370.  **We need to beat that score** . So make sure to be  all be here for the next practice.
